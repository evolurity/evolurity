##  About me:
<p>

  - defined a stack of technologies and tools for the implementation of specific business tasks, <br>
  - discussed and formalized business requirements, <br>
  - decomposed tasks, planned team sprints, <br>
  - designed a scalable and maintainable architecture, <br>
  - made architectural decisions, improved the quality of the code base and reduced the amount of technical debt of projects, tracked project coverage with tests, <br>
  - optimized the performance of the client side of web applications, <br>
  - configured dev build and continuous integration for projects, <br>
  - participated in the code review of my team, mentoring and introducing new developers to the project. <br>

  At the moment I continue to work as a Frontend Developer. <br>
  I follow the news and trends in development, I develop both in technical and product directions. <br>
