##  About me:
<p>
   I'm a Frontend Developer. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science.
  I have been working in IT for over four years.
  During my career, I have worked on many projects in the field of medicine, fintech, banking, real estate and construction, developed blogs, online stores and landing pages.
  On projects, I was responsible for front-end product development, participated in the full development cycle:
  - developed front-end part of web applications based on React, TypeScript, JavaScript and Redux technology stack,
  - defined a stack of technologies and tools for the implementation of specific business tasks,
  - discussed and formalized business requirements,
  - decomposed tasks, planned team sprints,
  - designed a scalable and maintainable architecture,
  - made architectural decisions, improved the quality of the code base and reduced the amount of technical debt of projects, tracked project coverage with tests,
  - optimized the performance of the client side of web applications,
  - configured dev build and continuous integration for projects,
  - participated in the code review of my team, mentoring and introducing new developers to the project.

  At the moment I continue to work as a Frontend Developer.
  I follow the news and trends in development, I develop both in technical and product directions.
  I go in the direction of Staff and Principal Engineer.
  I prefer to work on projects using a modern and relevant front-end technology stack: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Redux.
  Feature-Sliced Design is my favorite architectural methodology for frontend projects.

  I currently live in Istanbul.
